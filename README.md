# Algo Club: Introduction to Recursion

## Objectives

By the end of today's Algo Club, you will be able to iteratively and recursively code two common algorithms, the exponent and Fibonacci sequence algorithms. You will also be able to explain what recursion is.

## Lesson Plan

1. Write an iterative function to solve the exponent of a base and a power.
2. Write a recursive function to solve the exponent of a base and a power.
    - What is a **recursive function**?
    - What are the two parts of a **recursive function**?
3. Write an iterative function to solve the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence.
4. Write a recursive function to solve the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence.
5. Optionally, add more recursive algorithms, such as calculating the nth value of the Lucas numbers sequence, calculating the factorial of a number, or performing binary search.
